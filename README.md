# Simple ML Model

A beginner-friendly machine learning project implementing Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms using Python.

## Overview

This project was created as a learning exercise following a tutorial from [The Data Professor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29ZQ3TDGgRQ) on YouTube. It demonstrates the fundamentals of machine learning model implementation and comparison.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Linear Regression**: A statistical approach for modeling the relationship between variables
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees

## Tools & Environment

- **Platform**: Google Colab
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib (for visualizations)

### Prerequisites
- Google account (for Google Colab)
- Basic understanding of Python

### Running the Project
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Observe the model performance comparisons
